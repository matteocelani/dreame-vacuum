# Xiaomi Vacuum

A Home Assistant integration for Xiaomi robot vacuums, and for every Dreame, MOVA, Mijia, and TROUVER device from [Tasshack/dreame-vacuum](https://github.com/Tasshack/dreame-vacuum).

Maintained by [@matteocelani](https://github.com/matteocelani). Fork of [@Tasshack](https://github.com/Tasshack)'s upstream project. Not an official Dreame or Xiaomi product.

## What this repository is

[Xiaomi Vacuum](https://github.com/matteocelani/xiaomi-vacuum) is both of these things:

- Support for every Dreame, MOVA, Mijia, and TROUVER robot vacuum and mop from [Tasshack/dreame-vacuum](https://github.com/Tasshack/dreame-vacuum), including the accounts and local control that project documents.
- Xiaomi robot vacuums, added one model at a time. The models in this tree are listed under [Supported Xiaomi models](#supported-xiaomi-models).

## Home Assistant still uses `dreame_vacuum`

The project name is **Xiaomi Vacuum**. The integration shows up in Home Assistant as `dreame_vacuum`, so installed config entries, entity ids, and automations keep working. Renaming the domain needs its own council decision, recorded in [0001](.agent/council/records/0001-xiaomi-wide-rename-and-expansion.md).

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Repository | [matteocelani/xiaomi-vacuum](https://github.com/matteocelani/xiaomi-vacuum) |
| HACS repository | `https://github.com/matteocelani/xiaomi-vacuum` |
| Home Assistant domain | `dreame_vacuum` |
| Installed folder | `custom_components/dreame_vacuum` |
| Entities and services | `dreame_vacuum.*` |
| Config entries | stored on `dreame_vacuum` |
| Name in HACS and Home Assistant | Dreame Vacuum (`hacs.json` and `manifest.json`) |

`matteocelani/dreame-vacuum` redirects to `matteocelani/xiaomi-vacuum`. [Tasshack/dreame-vacuum](https://github.com/Tasshack/dreame-vacuum) is the upstream project and stays at that address.

## Install

In HACS, add `https://github.com/matteocelani/xiaomi-vacuum` as a custom repository (category: Integration), then download it. HACS lists that download as Dreame Vacuum, the name in `hacs.json`. The [HACS default listing](https://github.com/hacs/default) for this kind of vacuum is the upstream repository [Tasshack/dreame-vacuum](https://github.com/Tasshack/dreame-vacuum), a different install. After Xiaomi Vacuum is installed, Home Assistant still registers the domain `dreame_vacuum`.

Minimum Home Assistant version is 2024.2.0.

### Dreame, MOVA, Mijia, and TROUVER

Configure a Dreame, MOVA, Mijia, or TROUVER vacuum with the upstream guides. Those guides match the domain `dreame_vacuum` and the behavior this fork tracks:

- [Installation](https://dreame-vacuum.tasshack.com/installation), including [HACS](https://dreame-vacuum.tasshack.com/installation/hacs) and [manual](https://dreame-vacuum.tasshack.com/installation/manually) steps for the upstream project
- [Dreamehome](https://dreame-vacuum.tasshack.com/configuration/dreamehome)
- [Xiaomi Home](https://dreame-vacuum.tasshack.com/configuration/xiaomihome), the account type many Dreame, MOVA, Mijia, and TROUVER vacuums use
- [MOVAhome](https://dreame-vacuum.tasshack.com/configuration/movahome)
- [TROUVER](https://dreame-vacuum.tasshack.com/configuration/trouver)
- [Local control](https://dreame-vacuum.tasshack.com/configuration/local) over the LAN
- [Configuration options](https://dreame-vacuum.tasshack.com/configuration-options)

### Supported Xiaomi models

`resolve_family` in `custom_components/dreame_vacuum/xiaomi/` recognizes these models. Add a row when a model is registered there.

Map, rooms, and zones are not supported yet on Xiaomi models. These models were tested on a simulated robot, not real hardware. A manual check for a real S20+ or X20 Max is [hardware-test-s20-plus-x20-max.md](hardware-test-s20-plus-x20-max.md). That procedure does not add map, room, or zone support.

## Features

What the integration does today for Dreame, MOVA, Mijia, and TROUVER vacuums inherited from upstream:

- Wide range of Dreame, MOVA, Mijia, and TROUVER robot vacuums and mops, configurable with a Dreamehome, MOVAhome, or Xiaomi Home account, or fully locally without the cloud
- Almost every setting and state exposed dynamically as auto-generated entities
- Live and multi-floor map support with zone, spot, and room cleaning
- Per-room suction, water volume, and cleaning order for customized cleaning
- Persistent notifications and events for automations
- Cleaning and cruising history, obstacle photos, map backup and recovery, and saved Wi-Fi maps
- Backend translations for 40 languages
- Interactive map editor via the embedded [Dreame Vacuum Card](https://dreame-vacuum-card.tasshack.com/)
